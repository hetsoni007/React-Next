Act as a senior product engineer, UX strategist, analytics specialist, and high-ticket services sales consultant.

THIS IS A MICRO-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION TASK.
DO NOT redesign, rebuild, or rewrite the website.

------------------------------------------------
ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE)
------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT change layout
- Do NOT change colors, fonts, spacing, or visual style
- Do NOT rewrite or replace existing text content
- Do NOT add new pages or remove pages
- Do NOT add new UI components
- Do NOT add aggressive CTAs or sales copy
- Do NOT change the tech stack
- Do NOT break existing animations
- Make ONLY subtle behavioral, pacing, comfort, and analytics improvements

------------------------------------------------
PROJECT CONTEXT
------------------------------------------------
- Website is built with React / Next.js on Replit
- Design is Apple-inspired, calm, premium
- Traffic mainly comes from email campaigns (cold / semi-warm)
- Users currently stay ~1 minute and leave
- Conversions are low
- Analytics page names are unclear or messy
- Goal is validation, comfort, clarity, and conversation initiation
- NOT forcing sales, NOT forcing long sessions

------------------------------------------------
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------------
1. Improve perceived comfort and trust at a micro level
2. Increase average engagement slightly (+15–40 seconds)
3. Reduce subconscious decision pressure
4. Fix analytics page naming so data becomes readable
5. Align website behavior with email-driven traffic
6. Achieve all of this WITHOUT changing the site’s look

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 1: MICRO ENGAGEMENT & COMFORT TUNING
------------------------------------------------
- Subtly reduce perceived scroll speed so content feels calmer
- Add very small delays between section reveals to avoid rushing
- Smooth transitions so sections feel intentional, not abrupt
- Ensure animations feel slower, deliberate, and reassuring
- Do not add new animations; only tune timing and pacing

GOAL:
Scrolling should feel like a guided experience, not a fast feed.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 2: MICRO INTERACTION FEEDBACK
------------------------------------------------
- Improve hover, focus, and click feedback on existing interactive elements
- Feedback must be subtle and professional
- Users should feel interactions are acknowledged
- No flashy effects, no visual noise

GOAL:
Reduce friction and hesitation without drawing attention.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 3: POPUP BEHAVIOR REFINEMENT (NO DESIGN CHANGE)
------------------------------------------------
- Keep popup design exactly the same
- Remove popup on immediate page load
- Trigger popup ONLY after meaningful engagement:
  - After ~40–50% scroll
  - OR after portfolio section is reached
  - OR after ~25–30 seconds on site
- Popup should feel like a helpful suggestion, not an interruption
- Do not increase frequency or aggressiveness

GOAL:
Popup appears when interest exists, not before.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 4: USER FLOW GUIDANCE (NO COPY CHANGE)
------------------------------------------------
- Subtly guide attention toward the primary action (conversation/contact)
- Reduce equal-weight competition between actions
- Do not make CTAs bigger, louder, or more colorful
- Make one action feel naturally “next” without forcing it

GOAL:
User feels guided, not asked to decide.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 5: AUTHORITY & TRUST EMPHASIS (WITHOUT ADDING TEXT)
------------------------------------------------
- Ensure existing authority signals feel slightly more prominent
- Use spacing, timing, visual emphasis, or reveal order
- Do NOT add or rewrite text

GOAL:
Site should feel led by a responsible decision-maker.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 6: CONTACT COMFORT IMPROVEMENT
------------------------------------------------
- Reduce perceived pressure around contact actions
- Make contact interactions feel conversational and low-commitment
- Avoid urgency, scarcity, or pushy behavior

GOAL:
User feels safe initiating a conversation.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 7: ANALYTICS PAGE LABELING FIX (CRITICAL)
------------------------------------------------
Fix page naming issues so analytics data becomes readable and useful.

Ensure every page sends a clear, stable, human-readable page label.

Use BUSINESS-INTENT labels, NOT URLs.

Use labels such as:
- "Home – Primary Entry"
- "Portfolio – Overview"
- "Portfolio – Case Study"
- "Blog – Overview"
- "Blog – Article"
- "Services – Overview"
- "Contact – Intent"

Rules:
- Do NOT expose raw routes, slugs, or dynamic filenames
- Dynamic routes must map to consistent parent labels
- Page labels must remain stable across navigation and refresh
- Avoid "(not set)" and duplicate naming issues

GOAL:
Analytics clearly shows which page types users visit and how long they stay.

------------------------------------------------
TASK GROUP 8: ANALYTICS NOISE REDUCTION
------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT add excessive tracking events
- Do NOT track scroll depth here
- Do NOT add experimental metrics
- Focus ONLY on clean page identification and session clarity

GOAL:
Readable, actionable analytics without clutter.

------------------------------------------------
FINAL OUTCOME EXPECTATION
------------------------------------------------
- Website looks exactly the same
- Website feels calmer and more confident
- Users stay slightly longer without feeling pushed
- Email traffic feels validated instead of overwhelmed
- Analytics page names are clean and understandable
- Lead initiation feels safer and more natural

END OF TASK.
