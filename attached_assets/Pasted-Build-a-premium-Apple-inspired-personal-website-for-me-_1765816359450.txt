Build a premium, Apple-inspired personal website for me that focuses on App & Web Development lead generation.
The website must feel calm, professional, high-end, and relaxing — similar to Apple’s UI/UX philosophy.
Use only black, white, and grey color combinations with strong contrast, smooth curves, realistic shadows, and depth.

The primary goal is lead generation, while maintaining a professional standard that founders, CTOs, and product leaders trust.
