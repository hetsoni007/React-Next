DO NOT rebuild the website.
DO NOT recreate the planner or existing logic.

Act as a senior CRO strategist, Apple-style UX refiner,
SEO content architect, and frontend engineer.

I have ALREADY IMPLEMENTED:
• A Project Planning / Requirement Tool
• Website content pages
• Blog pages

Your task is to IMPROVE, CONNECT, and POLISH
the existing implementation for higher CRO, SEO, and UX.

––––––––––––––––––––
CORE OBJECTIVE
––––––––––––––––––––

• Make the Project Planner highly visible without navigation
• Improve homepage SEO & engagement
• Add Simple Website (WordPress / Webflow) option
• Clean up and restructure popups
• Refine UX using Apple-style psychology
• Restructure Blog page into creative visual grids
• Ensure all blog content is PUBLIC and readable by everyone

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 1: ADD SIMPLE WEBSITE OPTION
––––––––––––––––––––

Update EXISTING planner Step 1:

Add option:
• “Simple Website”

When selected:
• Show platform options:
  - WordPress
  - Webflow
  - Not sure (we’ll recommend)

Show calm pricing note:
“Small Website — Starting at $499 USD.
Custom features, plugins, integrations, or animations are scoped separately.”

Keep this path separate from:
• Mobile apps
• Custom web apps
• AI products

NO random pricing.
NO estimator logic for simple websites.

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 2: HOMEPAGE CONTENT (SEO + UX)
––––––––––––––––––––

Improve homepage structure and copy for:
• Better SEO ranking
• Clear user guidance
• Higher engagement

Update homepage sections:

1) HERO SECTION
• SEO-optimized H1 (Mobile App Development, React Native, Web Development)
• Clear value proposition
• PRIMARY CTA:
  “Plan Your Project”
• SECONDARY CTA:
  “Contact Us”

2) SERVICES OVERVIEW
Include clean, keyword-aware blocks:
• Mobile App Development (React Native)
• Web Development
• WordPress & Webflow Websites
• UI/UX Design
• AI Development

Each block includes:
“Plan this project →” (links to planner)

3) PROJECT PLANNER INTRO SECTION (MID-PAGE)
Explain:
• What the planner does
• Why it helps users
• 24-hour response promise

CTA:
“Start Project Planning”

4) PROCESS / ROADMAP
Display:
• Planning
• Design
• Development
• Testing
• Deployment
• Support

Simple, non-technical language.

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 3: PLANNER VISIBILITY (NO NAVIGATION)
––––––––––––––––––––

• Do NOT add planner to navigation
• Do NOT rely only on popups

Use instead:
• Homepage hero CTA
• Mid-page homepage CTA
• Contact page top CTA
• Service page bottom CTA
• Footer quick link

Planner must feel like a CORE PRODUCT.

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 4: CONTACT PAGE INTEGRATION
––––––––––––––––––––

At the TOP of Contact page:

Add a short section:
“Want faster and more accurate help?
Use our Project Planner to share your requirements clearly.
Our team will review it carefully.”

Button:
“Use Project Planner”

Keep the existing contact form below.

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 5: POPUP CLEANUP & RESTRUCTURE
––––––––––––––––––––

Remove ALL existing popups except TWO.

POPUP #1 – Intent-Based Helper Popup
• Trigger: 50–60% scroll OR 30–40 seconds
• Show once per session
• Do NOT ask for email
• Do NOT show on:
  - Planner page
  - Contact page
  - Privacy / Terms pages

Content:
Title:
“Planning a Website or App?”

Text:
“Use our guided Project Planner to share your requirements clearly.
We’ll review everything and get back to you within 24 hours.”

CTA:
“Plan Your Project”

Secondary:
“Not now”

POPUP #2 – Exit Intent Popup

Content:
Title:
“Not sure where to start?”

NO other popups should exist.

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 6: BLOG PAGE RESTRUCTURE (NEW)
––––––––––––––––––––

Restructure the existing Blog page into a CREATIVE VISUAL GRID layout.

Requirements:
• Use card-based grid layout (2–3 columns desktop, responsive on mobile)
• Each blog card must include:
  - Featured image
  - Blog title
  - Short excerpt
  - Read time or category (optional)
• Entire card should be clickable

UX Rules:
• Clean spacing
• Rounded corners
• Soft hover animation (lift or fade)
• Apple-style minimal design
• No clutter

IMPORTANT:
• ALL blogs must be PUBLIC
• No login or membership restriction
• Anyone can read full blog content

Add optional filters:
• By category
• By topic (optional, if already exists)

––––––––––––––––––––
TASK 7: CRO & PSYCHOLOGY REFINEMENTS
––––––––––––––––––––

Refine existing copy to reinforce:
• “We care about your idea”
• “We guide you step-by-step”

Inject subtle micro-copy:
• “This helps us understand your vision”
• “You can change this later”
• “There’s no right or wrong choice”
• “We’ll guide you if anything is unclear”

Avoid:
• Sales hype
• Urgency
• Discounts
• Aggressive CTAs
