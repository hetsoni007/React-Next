DO NOT rebuild from scratch.
I already have a Project Planning / Requirement Tool implemented.

Act as a senior conversion-rate-optimization (CRO) strategist,
UX designer, and growth-focused frontend engineer.

My PRIMARY BUSINESS GOAL:
Generate consistent, high-quality service inquiries.

Benchmark:
From 200 email marketing visitors,
I want at least 10 serious project inquiries (≈5% conversion).

CORE STRATEGY
––––––––––––––––––––

This website must function as a LEAD GENERATION MACHINE,
not a brochure.

The primary conversion action across the site is:
“Plan Your Project”

Everything else supports this action.

––––––––––––––––––––
HOMEPAGE (CRITICAL)
––––––––––––––––––––

Update homepage so that within 5 seconds users understand:
• What we do
• Who it’s for
• What to do next

Hero section must include:
• Clear headline (web + mobile development)
• Short supportive subtext
• ONE primary CTA:
  “Plan Your Project”
• Secondary CTA (less prominent):
  “Contact Us”

Remove competing CTAs.

––––––––––––––––––––
PROJECT PLANNER POSITIONING
––––––––––––––––––––

The planner is the MAIN lead capture tool.

Ensure planner is accessible via:
• Homepage hero CTA
• Mid-page homepage section
• Service pages (bottom CTA)
• Contact page (top CTA)
• Footer quick link

Do NOT add to navigation.
Do NOT rely on popups alone.

––––––––––––––––––––
PLANNER GOAL
––––––––––––––––––––

The planner must:
• Reduce fear
• Guide thinking
• Collect structured inputs
• Feel like free consultation

It must support users who:
• Know exactly what they want
• Have a rough idea
• Have no idea and need guidance

Provide an option:
“I’m not sure what to build yet”
→ Encourage direct connection.

––––––––––––––––––––
NO PRICING, NO PROMISES
––––––––––––––––––––

• Do NOT show calculated prices
• Do NOT estimate costs
• Do NOT promise timelines

Timeline input must be CLIENT-PREFERRED only:
• Immediate
• 1–3 weeks
• 1 month
• 1–3 months

Language:
“This helps us understand your priority.”

––––––––––––––––––––
TECH STACK & HOSTING
––––––––––––––––––––

Allow users to:
• Get recommended tech stack
• OR choose their own (frontend, backend, database)
• OR enter manual inputs

Allow hosting choice:
• Recommend for me
• I already have hosting

Show hosting as monthly consideration only.

––––––––––––––––––––
TRUST & RESPONSE
––––––––––––––––––––

Reinforce:
• “We’ll review and respond within 24 hours”
• GDPR & HIPAA-aligned data practices

Show this near final submission and in PDF.

––––––––––––––––––––
BLOG & AUTHORITY
––––––––––––––––––––

Restructure blog into visual grid.
All blogs public.
Use blog to build trust and authority,
not to gate content.

––––––––––––––––––––
SUCCESS METRICS
––––––––––––––––––––

After improvements:
• Clear next action everywhere
• Planner feels like free consulting
• Cold traffic feels safe
• Inquiry rate reaches 5%+
