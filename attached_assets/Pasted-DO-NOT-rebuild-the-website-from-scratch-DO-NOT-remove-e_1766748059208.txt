DO NOT rebuild the website from scratch.
DO NOT remove existing pages or logic.

Act as a senior CRO strategist, UX content architect,
and growth-focused frontend engineer.

My website (soniconsultancyservices.com) already exists
and provides software development services.

GOAL:
Increase audience engagement, time-on-site, and service inquiries
from email marketing, LinkedIn traffic, and organic visitors.

This upgrade is NOT only about the Project Planner.
It is about making the entire website more engaging,
decision-friendly, and trust-driven.

––––––––––––––––––––
ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (CORE)
––––––––––––––––––––

The website must help visitors:
• Understand their situation
• Explore options without pressure
• Learn how decisions are made
• Feel confident before contacting us

Avoid aggressive selling.
Avoid pricing emphasis.
Focus on guidance and clarity.

––––––––––––––––––––
HOMEPAGE ENGAGEMENT UPGRADES
––––––––––––––––––––

1) ADD A “HELP ME DECIDE” SECTION (HIGH IMPACT)

Add a homepage section with the heading:
“Not sure what you actually need?”

Subtext:
“Most people aren’t. Let’s help you figure it out.”

Provide click-based options:
• Website
• Web Application
• Mobile App
• I’m not sure — help me decide

Each option should guide users to relevant content
or an appropriate starting point (planner or contact),
not force a form immediately.

––––––––––––––––––––
2) ADD A “HOW WE THINK” SECTION

Replace generic “Why Choose Us” language with:

Heading:
“How we think about your project”

Short bullet points explaining:
• We focus on clarity before development
• We suggest the simplest viable solution
• We think long-term scalability
• We guide first, build second

This section must feel consultative, not promotional.

––––––––––––––––––––
3) ADD USE-CASE WALKTHROUGHS (NO CASE STUDIES REQUIRED)

Add a section:
“How projects like yours are usually built”

Include 3–4 common use cases:
• Simple marketing website
• Startup MVP
• Internal business tool
• Mobile app for teams

For each use case, show:
• Goal
• Typical features
• Common mistakes
• High-level tech approach
• Typical timeline preference (no promises)

No pricing.

––––––––––––––––––––
BLOG ENGAGEMENT UPGRADE
––––––––––––––––––––

Restructure blog pages to be engagement-focused.

• Keep all blogs public
• Use visual grid layout
• Improve readability and spacing

At the end of every blog post, add a soft CTA:

“Thinking about something similar?
Here’s how we usually guide teams.”

Provide a button or link to:
• Explore options
• Plan a project
• Talk to us

Avoid hard selling.

––––––––––––––––––––
VISUAL ROADMAP SECTION
––––––––––––––––––––

Add a simple visual section on homepage and service pages:

Heading:
“From idea to launch”

Steps:
• Understand the idea
• Define scope
• Choose the right tech
• Build and test
• Launch and support

This reduces anxiety and increases engagement.

––––––––––––––––––––
FOUNDER / HUMAN PRESENCE
––––––––––––––––––––

Add a short human section:

“A note from the founder”

Include:
• Why the company was started
• How client projects are approached
• Focus on trust, clarity, and long-term success

This should feel personal and honest.

––––––––––––––––––––
CONTACT PAGE ENGAGEMENT FIX
––––––––––––––––––––

On the Contact page, add a section ABOVE the form:

Heading:
“Not ready to talk yet?”

Text:
“If you’re still figuring things out, that’s okay.
We help people at the idea stage too.”

Provide options:
• Explore options
• Plan a project
• Talk to someone

Then keep the contact form below.

––––––––––––––––––––
LANGUAGE & UX RULES
––––––––––––––––––––

• Use calm, reassuring language
• Avoid technical overload
• Avoid sales buzzwords
• Keep paragraphs short
• Use click-based interactions instead of long text
• Make users feel understood, not judged

––––––––––––––––––––
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
––––––––––––––––––––

• Do NOT introduce pricing
• Do NOT add aggressive CTAs
• Do NOT rely on popups for engagement
• Do NOT overwhelm users with choices

––––––––––––––––––––
SUCCESS METRICS
––––––––––––––––––––

• Scroll depth improves
• More users explore multiple sections
• More inquiries come from informed users
• Website feels like guidance, not marketing
