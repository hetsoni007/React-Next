Act as a senior product architect, marketing strategist, UX designer,
and full-stack engineer.

I want to build a HIGH-ENGAGEMENT, STEP-BY-STEP PROJECT ESTIMATION &
PLANNING TOOL for my software services website:
soniconsultancyservices.com

This tool must feel PROFESSIONAL, SIMPLE, TRUST-BUILDING,
and must work equally well for:
• Non-technical clients (founders, business owners)
• Technical clients (CTOs, engineers)

The goal is NOT just to calculate cost, but to:
• Help clients understand their project concept
• Guide them step-by-step
• Generate a milestone-based ball-park estimation
• Increase engagement & conversions
• Collect structured lead data
• Deliver a branded professional PDF in minutes

SCOPE (STRICT)

This tool is ONLY for:
• Web Application Development
• Mobile Application Development (Android / iOS / Both)

CORE EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES

• Each step must increase clarity & engagement
• No email until the FINAL step
• Mostly click-based inputs (no heavy typing)
• Optional shortcuts for complex projects
• Minimal, aesthetic, professional UI
• Smooth animations, micro-interactions & loaders
• Avoid flashy UI, aggressive sales language, or gimmicks

ADAPTIVE USER EXPERIENCE
