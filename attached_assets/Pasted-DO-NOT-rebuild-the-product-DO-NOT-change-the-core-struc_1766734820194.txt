DO NOT rebuild the product.
DO NOT change the core structure or step flow.

Act as a senior CRO specialist and Apple-style UX refiner.
Your task is to IMPROVE the EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION
based on preview feedback and real user psychology.

––––––––––––––––––––
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
––––––––––––––––––––

Refine the current Project Planning & Requirement Tool so that:
• Users feel we are genuinely interested in their idea
• Every step feels valuable, calm, and intentional
• The experience feels Apple-like, not form-like
• Conversion rate increases without adding steps

––––––––––––––––––––
WHAT TO KEEP AS-IS
––––––––––––––––––––

• Existing step flow
• Existing logic & routing
• Existing fields & data structure
• Existing submission & email handling
• Existing PDF generation

DO NOT add new steps unless necessary.
Focus on UX, copy, and behavior improvements.

KEY UX IMPROVEMENTS TO APPLY
––––––––––––––––––––

1) MICRO-COPY REFINEMENT (MOST IMPORTANT)

Update labels and helper text so they:
• Explain WHY the question is asked
• Reassure users they can change things later
• Reduce fear of “wrong answers”

Examples to inject subtly:
• “This helps us understand your vision”
• “You’re not expected to know everything”
• “There’s no right or wrong choice here”
• “We’ll guide you if anything is unclear”

Do NOT add long paragraphs.
Short, calm sentences only.

––––––––––––––––––––

2) STEP VALIDATION FEEDBACK

After each step completion:
• Add a subtle confirmation line like:
  “This gives us a clear direction.”
  “That’s helpful for planning.”

This creates the feeling of progress and care.

––––––––––––––––––––

3) REDUCE FORM-LIKE FEELING

Wherever possible:
• Replace “Enter / Fill / Submit” with:
  “Share”, “Tell us”, “Help us understand”

• Replace “Next” with:
  “Continue”
  “Next step”

Small wording changes only.

––––––––––––––––––––

4) APPLE-STYLE MOTION POLISH

Refine existing animations:
• Slow transitions slightly (calm, not rushed)
• Use fade + slight slide only
• Remove any bounce, shake, or aggressive easing
• Keep loaders minimal with reassuring text

Loader text examples:
• “Reviewing your inputs…”
• “Organizing your requirements…”

––––––––––––––––––––

5) PRICING PERCEPTION CLEANUP

Ensure:
• No random numbers appear anywhere
• $499 website pricing is shown calmly as:
  “Website Project (Small Scope) — Starting at $499 USD”
• Add subtle note:
  “Custom features and add-ons are reviewed separately”

Do NOT emphasize price visually.

––––––––––––––––––––

6) FINAL SUBMISSION PSYCHOLOGY

Refine the final screen message to feel personal:

Instead of generic success text, use:
“Thank you for sharing your idea with us.
Our team will carefully review your requirements
and get back to you within 24 hours.”

This wording is mandatory.

––––––––––––––––––––

7) DATA TRUST SIGNAL (KEEP SUBTLE)

Ensure this line exists near final submit button:
“We follow GDPR and HIPAA-aligned practices to protect your data.”

• Small font
• Neutral color
• No banners or icons

––––––––––––––––––––

8) CTA VISIBILITY REFINEMENT (NO NEW BUTTONS)

Refine existing CTA styles so:
• One primary CTA stands out
• Uses a single accent color
• Feels confident, not promotional

Preferred CTA language:
• “Start Planning”
• “Plan Your Product”
• “Continue Planning”

Avoid:
• “Get Quote”
• “Instant”
• “Offer”

––––––––––––––––––––
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
––––––––––––––––––––

• Do NOT add new steps
• Do NOT change backend logic
• Do NOT add popups or modals
• Do NOT introduce new pricing models
• Focus on clarity, calmness, and care

––––––––––––––––––––
SUCCESS CRITERIA
––––––––––––––––––––

After refinements:
• Tool feels like a consultation, not a form
• Users feel guided, not questioned
• Flow feels lighter and calmer
• Brand feels premium and trustworthy
• CRO improves without pressure

Apply changes incrementally and safely.
