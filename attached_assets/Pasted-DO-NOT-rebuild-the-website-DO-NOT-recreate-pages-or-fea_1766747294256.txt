DO NOT rebuild the website.
DO NOT recreate pages or features from scratch.

Act as a senior CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) strategist,
Apple-style UX designer, SEO content architect,
and growth-focused frontend engineer.

My website (soniconsultancyservices.com) already exists and offers
web, mobile app, AI, and software development services.

PRIMARY BUSINESS GOAL:
Turn website traffic into qualified service inquiries.

TARGET BENCHMARK:
From 200 cold visitors (email / LinkedIn traffic),
generate at least 10 real project inquiries (≈5% conversion).

––––––––––––––––––––
OVERALL STRATEGY
––––––––––––––––––––

Transform the website from a SERVICE BROCHURE
into a LEAD-GENERATION SYSTEM.

The website must:
• Guide confused users
• Reduce fear and pressure
• Feel like free consulting
• Collect structured requirements
• Push ONE primary action everywhere

PRIMARY ACTION:
“Plan Your Project”

Everything else supports this action.

––––––––––––––––––––
HOMEPAGE (MOST IMPORTANT)
––––––––––––––––––––

Upgrade homepage to act like a high-conversion landing page.

HERO SECTION MUST:
• Clearly state what we do (web + mobile development)
• Clearly state who it’s for (businesses, startups)
• Clearly tell users what to do next

Hero must include:
• Strong, clear headline
• Short supportive subtext
• ONE dominant CTA:
  “Plan Your Project”
• Secondary CTA (less visual weight):
  “Contact Us”

Remove competing CTAs above the fold.

––––––––––––––––––––
PROJECT PLANNER = CORE PRODUCT
––––––––––––––––––––

The Project Planner is the MAIN lead capture tool.

Make it discoverable WITHOUT adding it to navigation.

Ensure planner CTAs exist in:
• Homepage hero
• Homepage mid-section
• All service pages (bottom CTA)
• Contact page (top CTA)
• Blog pages (footer CTA)
• Footer quick link

Planner must feel like:
“The correct way to start with us.”

––––––––––––––––––––
PLANNER PURPOSE
––––––––––––––––––––

The planner is NOT a pricing calculator.

It must:
• Help users think clearly
• Work even if users have no idea
• Ask simple, click-based questions
• Collect expectations, not commitments

Include an option:
“I’m not sure what to build yet”
→ Encourage direct connection with the team.

––––––––––––––––––––
NO PRICING (STRICT RULE)
––––––––––––––––––––

Do NOT show:
• Calculated prices
• Estimated costs
• Feature-based totals
• Random numbers

For simple websites ONLY show static text:
“Simple Website — Starting from $499 USD.
Final scope is reviewed after submission.”

No other pricing anywhere.

––––––––––––––––––––
TIMELINE INPUT (CLIENT-PREFERRED ONLY)
––––––––––––––––––––

Timeline must be user preference, not system logic.

Ask:
“When would you like this project to be completed?”

Options ONLY:
• Immediate
• 1–3 weeks
• 1 month
• 1–3 months

Helper text:
“This helps us understand your priority. You can change this later.”

Do NOT calculate timelines.
Do NOT promise delivery dates.

––––––––––––––––––––
TECH STACK & HOSTING (HIGH-VALUE SECTION)
––––––––––––––––––––

Allow two modes:

Mode 1: Recommend for me
• Suggest frontend, backend, database, hosting
• Based on project type and scale

Mode 2: I have preferences
• Allow manual selection or input of:
  - Frontend
  - Backend
  - Database
  - Hosting provider

Hosting must show:
• Monthly consideration only
• Option to use existing hosting

No development pricing.

––––––––––––––––––––
CONTACT PAGE (LEAD QUALITY FIX)
––––––––––––––––––––

At the TOP of Contact page:
Encourage planner usage first:

“Want faster and more accurate help?
Use our Project Planner to share your requirements clearly.
We’ll review and respond within 24 hours.”

Button:
“Use Project Planner”

Keep contact form below.

––––––––––––––––––––
BLOG PAGE (AUTHORITY + CONVERSION)
––––––––––––––––––––

Upgrade blog into a creative visual grid:
• Card-based layout
• Image, title, excerpt
• Entire card clickable
• Clean Apple-style spacing

IMPORTANT:
• All blogs must be PUBLIC
• No membership or login restriction

At the end of every blog:
Soft CTA:
“Planning a project? Plan it with us.”

––––––––––––––––––––
POPUP CLEANUP (SUPPORTING ONLY)
––––––––––––––––––––

Remove all popups except TWO:

Popup 1 (Intent-based):
• Trigger after 50–60% scroll or 30–40 seconds
• CTA: “Plan Your Project”
• Show once per session

Popup 2 (Exit intent):
• CTA: “Start Planning”

Do NOT show popups on:
• Planner page
• Contact page
• Privacy / Terms pages

Popups must support, not interrupt.

––––––––––––––––––––
TRUST & RESPONSE ASSURANCE
––––––––––––––––––––

Reinforce trust subtly:
• “We’ll review and respond within 24 hours”
• “We follow GDPR and HIPAA-aligned practices”

Show near final submission and in PDF footer.

––––––––––––––––––––
SUCCESS CRITERIA
––––––––––––––––––––

After upgrade:
• Users know what to do in 5 seconds
• Planner feels like free consulting
• Cold traffic feels safe
• Homepage guides action clearly
• Lead quality improves
• Conversion rate reaches 5%+

––––––––––––––––––––
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
––––––––––––––––––––

• Do NOT rebuild everything
• Do NOT add complexity
• Do NOT introduce pricing
• Do NOT add planner to navigation
• Focus on clarity, guidance, and lead generation
